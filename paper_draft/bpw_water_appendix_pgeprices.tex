As described in Section~\ref{sec:data} of the main text, PGE offers 23 distinct agricultural tariffs, which fall into 5 categories, depending on a farmer's meter type (conventional vs. smart) and pumping capital (small, large, or previously powered by an internal combustion engine). Here, we present additional details on these rates. Table~\ref{tab:pge_ag_tariffs} describes each rate in detail, including a description of the eligibility category, the broad pricing schedule on each rate, and the share of customers on each rate within our sample. Figure~\ref{fig:marg_price_all_rates} shows a time series of each rate over our sample. This is analogous to Figure~\ref{fig:marg_price_5_default_rates} in the main text, but shows all rates in addition to the ``default'' within-category rate. All rates that are the same color in Figure~\ref{fig:marg_price_all_rates} belong to the same category; the default rate for each category is bolded. The left panel shows the raw rate time series. The right panel shows residualized rates, after partialling out tariff $\times$ month-of-year fixed effects and month-of-sample fixed effects.
