\caption*{\footnotesize \emph{Notes:} This figure reports the times series of monthly average marginal electricity prices (\$/kWh) for three of the most common agricultural tariffs. Prices are systematically higher during summer months (May--October). Much of our identifying variation in monthly electricity prices comes from these monthly price times series not rising perfectly in parallel. }
