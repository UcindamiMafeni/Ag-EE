\caption*{\scriptsize \emph{Notes:} This is a histogram of measured horsepower for all 21,851 tests in our APEP pump test dataset. We observe no bunching on either side of the 35 hp cutoff that determines whether PGE classifies pumps as small or large. Bunching would be a sign that farmers optimize against PGE's tariff schedules when making pump investment decisions.}
