\caption*{\scriptsize \emph{Notes:} This figure plots the change in cropped area for nine water-intensive California crops from 2010 (light shaded) to 2017 (dark shaded): before and after the historic droughts of the mid-2010s. Crops in dark blue are relatively lower value per acre, while crops in light blue are relatively high value per acre. Acres planted measured using the USDA's Cropland Data Layer.}
