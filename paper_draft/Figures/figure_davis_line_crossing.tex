\caption*{\scriptsize \emph{Notes:} This figure plots annual profits per acre by crop, as reported by the UC Davis Cost Studies. We focus on five crop-specific studies in the Southern San Joaqu\'{i}n Valley, and vary the average cost of water for irrigation while holding all other assumptions constant.}
