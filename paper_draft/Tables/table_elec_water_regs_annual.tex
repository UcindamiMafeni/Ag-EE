\caption*{\scriptsize \emph{Notes:} 
Each regression estimates Equation (\ref{eq:reg_elec_annual}) or Equation (\ref{eq:reg_water_annual}) at the service point by year level.
Columns (1) report results for electricity consumption, while Columns (2)--(6) report results for groundwater consumption.
Columns (1)--(2) include the full annual panel of SPs; they are analogous to the monthly regressions 
in Column (4) of Table \ref{tab:elec_regs_main} and in Column (5) of Table \ref{tab:water_regs_combined}, respectively. 
Columns (3)--(6) restrict the sample based on the observed crop history at each service point's assigned CLU (from 2008 to 2016). 
We classify individual CLU-years as annual crop, fruit/nut perennial crop, other perennial crop, or non-crop.
Column (3) includes service points in CLUs that always have the same crop type (annual, fruit/nut, other perennial) during our sample period.
Column (4) includes units in CLUs that always have at most 1 of the 3 crop types, and also fallow.
Column (5) includes units in CLUs that swtich between at least 2 of the crop types, and never fallow.
Column (6) includes units in CLUs that switch between at least 2 of the crop types, and also fallow.
These four subsamples are disjoint but not exhaustive, due to ambiguities in land cover classifications
(we require that at least 50 percent for CLU fall into a single category). 
All regressions apply two-stage least squares, instrumenting with unit $i$'s within-category default logged electricity price in year $y$.
``Physical capital'' is a categorical variable for (i) small pumps, (ii) large pumps, and (iii) internal combustion engines, and unit $\times$
physical capital fixed effects control for shifts in tariff category triggered by the installation of new pumping equipment.
Water basin $\times$ year fixed effects control for broad geographic trends in groundwater depth.
Water district $\times$ year fixed effects control for annual variation in surface water allocations.
All regressions drop solar NEM customers, customers with bad geocodes, years with irregular electricity bills
(e.g.\ first/last bills, bills longer/shorter than 1 month, overlapping bills for a single account), and incomplete years.
Groundwater regressions use a monthly time interval to assign rasterized groundwater levels.
Standard errors (in parentheses) are two-way clustered by service point and by county-year.
Significance: *** $p < 0.01$, ** $p < 0.05$, * $p < 0.10$.
